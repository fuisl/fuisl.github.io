## Math Formula Recognition

### Overview
Built an RNN-LSTM Seq2Seq model to convert CROHME handwritten formulas into LaTeX format.

### Key Features
* Implemented RNN-LSTM based Sequence-to-Sequence architecture
* Developed robust preprocessing and data-handling pipeline for training
* Evaluated model performances and empirically chose optimal hyperparameters
* Achieved accurate conversion of handwritten mathematical formulas to LaTeX

### Technologies Used
* RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* Sequence-to-Sequence Models
* CROHME Dataset
* LaTeX

### Source Code
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/fuisl)

### Technical Highlights
* Custom preprocessing pipeline for handwritten formula images
* Sequence-to-sequence learning for variable-length input/output
* Hyperparameter optimization for improved accuracy
* LaTeX syntax generation from visual input

### Impact
This project addresses a practical problem in digital education and document processing, enabling automatic conversion of handwritten mathematical notation to machine-readable format.
