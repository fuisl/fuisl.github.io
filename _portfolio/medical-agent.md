## Multi-modal Medical Agent for Tropical Diseases Diagnosis

### Overview
Built a multi-modal diagnostic agent using MedGemma, integrating visual and textual understanding for tropical disease analysis.

### Key Features
* Constructed medical Graph-based RAG for knowledge and reasoning grounding
* Implemented an agentic workflow that leverages MedGemma's multimodal reasoning for structured clinical guidance
* Curated and synthesized medical datasets—including TRINDS and public case reports—for evaluation and fine-tuning
* Fine-tuned MedGemma on task-specific objectives with PEFT to improve diagnostic accuracy and robustness
* Evaluated reasoning recall and accuracy via custom benchmark using RAGAS

### Technologies Used
* MedGemma
* Graph-based RAG
* PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
* RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment)
* TRINDS dataset

### Impact
This project demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI in medical diagnostics, particularly for tropical diseases where visual and textual information are both crucial for accurate diagnosis.
